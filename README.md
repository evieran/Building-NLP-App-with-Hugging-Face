# Building NLP App with Hugging Face Transformers
This repository is dedicated to educational purposes, guiding you through the process of building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application using Hugging Face Transformers. The project encompasses various aspects of NLP, including text generation, chatbot conversation, translation, question answering, and building a custom model with transfer learning.

# Overview
## 1. Setting Up the Environment
Before diving into the code, you will need to set up the environment by installing necessary dependencies. This includes:
TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Transformers, and other essential libraries.

## 2. Text Generation
Using the Hugging Face pipeline, you see how to generate synthetic text with GPT-2. It includes creating a text-generation pipeline and generating sequences from a given input text.

## 3. Chatbot Conversation and Translation
In this section, you will see how to create conversational pipelines with models like BlenderBot and utilize translation models like T5 for translating text between different languages.

## 4. Question Answering
This sections shows how to implement question-answering models by using pre-trained models and evaluate their performance. There is a step-by-step guide to question answering and model evaluation, using the Hugging Face's transformers and evaluate libraries.

## 5. Building a Custom Model with Transfer Learning
In thise section, you are going through:

- Loading Hugging Face Datasets: Loading and exploring a pre-labeled dataset.
- Encoding and Preprocessing the Dataset: Encoding text and exploring input IDs and attention masks.
- Creating the Model Architecture: Loading a pre-trained transformer and configuring it for sequence classification.
- Training the Sentiment Model: Training a sentiment model using TensorFlow.
- Predicting Sentiment with the Custom Model: Encoding the dataset and predicting sentiment with the trained model.

# Usage
Clone the repository and install the necessary packages as listed in the setup instructions. Notebooks and Python files within the repository are well-documented to guide you through each step of the process.
